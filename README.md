# C-Project-Learning

I am using this repo on GitHub to help gain new knowledge with C# to make video games and other projects I plan to use this to make things like simple RPG games, simple text based games with simple pixel art like the Oregon trail, and more! All projects will have proper credit and shotuout to their creators!
